## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
